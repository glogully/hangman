## Project Description
The Hangman Game Project is a simple Python implementation of the popular word-guessing game. The user is presented with a list of words, from which one word is selected randomly as the word to be guessed. The user then guesses one letter at a time until the whole word is guessed correctly or the allowed number of incorrect guesses is exhausted.

### Aim of the project:
The aim of this project is to create a simple, interactive, and fun game that helps users to learn and revise vocabulary. This project also serves as a practical exercise in Python programming, focusing on object-oriented design principles, control structures, and user interaction.

### What was learned:
Through this project, the understanding of Pythonâ€™s control structures and data types was enhanced, and practical experience with object-oriented programming principles and design was gained. It also helped in learning how to handle user inputs and provide user-friendly interaction and feedback.
